# ds334_final_project

This project includes Women's NCAA basketball data analysis. This year (2024), the viewership record was broken during the NCAA championship game, so what better time to explore the data and the person responsible for the growth of the sport, Cairlin Clark!

Project includes: 
- Tables of stats from both teams that were in championship game
- Comparison of team stats
- Interactive plots looking at player points
- Caitlin Clark historical season data comparison
