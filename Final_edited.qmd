Question: 
Did South Carolina deserve the win over Iowa in the NCAA National Championship for women's basketball?

Iowa Dataset

```{r}
url2 <- "https://www.espn.com/womens-college-basketball/team/stats/_/id/2294/iowa-hawkeyes"

h2 <- read_html(url2)

tab2 <- h2 |> html_nodes("table")


iowa_df <- tab2[[2]] |> html_table(fill = TRUE)

iowa_df
```
(Going to manually enter this into excel and add names column I can't figure out why r is separating the table from itself)

This data set includes variables:

NAME: Name of player
GP: Games played
MIN: Minutes played per game
PTS: Points per game
REB: Rebounds per game
AST: Assists per game
